    <h2> <a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Genos" title="Wiki" target="_blank">Genos</a> </h2>Genos (ジェノス, Jenosu) is the deuteragonist of One-Punch Man. He is a 19-year-old cyborg and the disciple of Saitama. He is always aiming to become more powerful and fights for justice. Under the Hero Association, he is given the name Demon Cyborg (鬼サイボーグ, Oni Saibōgu) and is currently S-Class Rank 14.
    <h2> Appearance </h2> Genos is a mechanical cyborg of average human height. His face and ears look like that of a normal human, made of artificial skin material, and his eyes have black scleras with yellow irises. He has spiky blond hair and his eyebrows are blond (brown in the anime). He also has pierced ears. Genos's wardrobe consists of normal street clothes with all of his upper-body attire being sleeveless as to allow his arms to transform without hassle. He has been shown to have many different sets of arms, with varying abilities and strengths. Notable examples of his various "arms" are those he used in his sparring match against Saitama and the arms he equipped to combat the meteor. Sometimes the arm sets he uses create a metal framing around his face, like when utilizing Arms Mode and in his Monster Association Arc Upgrade.
    <h2> Personality </h2> Genos is an extremely serious character, very rarely ever making jokes. He constantly strives to become stronger and pesters Saitama to train him frequently. Since becoming Saitama's disciple, Genos is very reverent and protective towards his "master", whom to an extent he envies, although he does express annoyance and disbelief at the mundane training regimen Saitama used to gain his powers.On most occasions, Genos acts as a comic foil to Saitama's clueless antics, using a variety of special techniques, battle tactics and robotic upgrades to combat villains (and sustaining terrible damage in the process), only to be outclassed by Saitama with a single punch. Due to Saitama's incredible strength, Genos is led to believe that there is a secret to Saitama's power.Despite their disparity in strength, Genos's diligence earns him greater recognition than his mentor. His superior acumen granted him immediate status as an S-Class hero within the Hero Association, compared to Saitama's C-Class designation. He also possesses seemingly vast wealth, enough to repair or upgrade his cyborg body and cover Saitama's rent on a regular basis.He eventually mellows out, and he recognizes that this is due to Saitama's influence. He eventually comes to respect Saitama not just for his power, but also for his character. This was shown when Genos remarks on how similar Sweet Mask is to Genos's former self when Sweet Mask brutally dispatches a group of alien prisoners with no mercy. Genos has slowly become less serious and becomes a bit curious about some minor things such as the meaning of fun.
